                        <strong>description.</strong>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>Plastifashion is a year-long project that my group and I focused on developing throughout our final year at CU Boulder. With a passion in material design and sustainability, our final project was centered around creating a high fashion piece completely out of recycled materials that we made on our own. Using recycled plastic gathered from different sources, we developed our own process for converting plastic cups into a usable yarn to weave our own fabric and construct a piece of clothing out of it. Plastifashion aims to create a polished high fashion garment using recycled materials and a website that beautifully documents our process and story.
                        </p>

                        <strong>implementation.</strong>
                        <br></br>
                        <p> As the individual in charge of the technical aspect of Plastifashion, I was solely in charge of creating the website that would come to house essential info about Plastifashion
                            (process, mission statement, etc.). Since this website was primarily going to be visual based, I decided to use React as it was best option for me to build a website with multiple
                            moving parts and was a great opportunity for me to get more practice with React and JSX. To get a good idea for what the website would look like, the team and I brainstormed different
                            themes we wanted to convey through the design and created <a href = "https://www.figma.com/file/g9fK98HreO86QOPtIeQXzQ/Plastifashion-Moodboards?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=ecH8DH6umjaMfENo-1" style="color: #5b7c99;">moodboards</a> 
                            in Figma to have a visual cue for it along with layout ideas. After creating more <a href = "https://www.figma.com/file/PYhXy4324J6B9YzaKjVe3V/01%2F30---Plastifashion-Mockup?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=1dW9WrfICrVbfk4k-1" style="color: #5b7c99;">mockups</a> for the layout of Plastifashion's website, I then proceeded to replicate those static mockups 
                            in React with hardcoded dummy data. Since this website was being simultaneously developed while we were also developing our own material, I finzalied ideas for the layout and animation of the website early on and would then fill in the pages with 
                            correct information as the project advanced. For this website, I wanted to make sure that the website could be viewable on any screen size and strived to avoid hard-coding sizes (instead of just using px and position: absolute for some elements, I would make sure that 
                            all elements would use 'em' or 'vw' as a unit and made everything work with flex). I also decided to use GSAP for seamless transitions (primarily seen in the process page) since I wanted extra practice for incorporating different libraries into a React app 
                            and thought that it would make information more easy to digest.

                        <strong>reflection.</strong>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>Despite being a final project for a class, this project is foremost a project of passion. The requirements for this project were very VERY open ended:
                            create something that can be coded using Java. While at first our initial plan was to just have a simple cafe game that would be text based, we took it a
                            step further and decided to create a mobile app (with only some past experience in Android Studio and none with LibGDX!) with 100% handmade assets. This project
                            allowed me to explore a different side of my skillset and develop skills that I normally don't get to focus on a daily basis. Being able to play a game where everything
                            - from the code to the visuals - was 100% created by our team was such a great feeling and has further sparked my passion in creating projects no matter how small or big.
