                        <p>You play as a barista in Lava Java, a popular coffee shop in the neighborhood! As a barista, you take orders from animal customers as they
                            walk into the shop. Customers can order a variety of drinks in their order (lattes, tea and matcha). Different combinations of ingredients 
                            and a timer are guaranteed to give players a new order to build each time as they race against time to satisfy the customer. Progress is tracked
                            via points which are rewarded by how quickly the player can finish the order. As you serve more customers, the drink orders spike up in difficulty
                            so stay on top of the game!
                        </p>

                        <strong>implementation.</strong>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>Since we were creating a game, a lot of planning had to be put into this project. Ultimately it was divided into these portions: Use cases, UML, 
                            UX, Scope and Architecture. Over the course of 2 weeks, we created various diagrams to see how different components of the application would interact
                            with each other and drew up mockups for a better visual representation of what we inteded the final product to look like and how the user would 
                            interact in the actual gameplay. Click <a href = "https://band-spinach-192.notion.site/object-oriented-analysis-and-design-cce4616ff9cd493aa3823072ab045d62" style="color: #5b7c99;">here</a> 
                            to view some of our early and final stage documentation of our project. Using Android Studio as our main IDE and LibGDX as our framework, we both worked together to
                            create Lava Java completely from scratch. Jeffery mainly handled the techincal portion while I helped in hand-creating the assets for the game. All assets in the game
                            were created by me in Procreate using a pixel pen. With collaboration and communication between the 2 of us, we were able to import these assets into Android Studio and 
                            make it fully interactable and functional in the game.
                        </p>

                        <strong>reflection.</strong>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>Despite being a final project for a class, this project is foremost a project of passion. The requirements for this project were very VERY open ended:
                            create something that can be coded using Java. While at first our initial plan was to just have a simple cafe game that would be text based, we took it a
                            step further and decided to create a mobile app (with only some past experience in Android Studio and none with LibGDX!) with 100% handmade assets. This project
                            allowed me to explore a different side of my skillset and develop skills that I normally don't get to focus on a daily basis. Being able to play a game where everything
                            - from the code to the visuals - was 100% created by our team was such a great feeling and has further sparked my passion in creating projects no matter how small or big.
